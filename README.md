Mental health in America (and across the world in general) has been rapidly deteriorating. This repo wants to fix that. Yes, it sounds stupid but my initial vision for this project is to leverage technology to create accessible, scalable and practical solutions for dealing with mental health issues. Basically, my theory is that if we can provide early help for people showing signs & symptoms of mental trouble, we can solve 50% of the problem. It's still a theory, but lets get to work and prove it.
